# Heat {#sec-heat}

## Objectives

-   Define heat, specific heat, temperature, and explain temperature measurement scales.

-   Explain state changes, latent heat, including fusion and evaporation, and their role in energy transfer.

-   Calculate the heat required to change the state of water and other substances.

-   Describe a simple calorimeter and use the calorimeter equation to calculate specific heat and final temperature.

-   Calculate water equivalents and perform calorimeter and heat calculations.


## Temperature

Temperature quantifies hotness or coldness and is measured with a thermometer. It reflects the average kinetic energy of vibrating and colliding atoms.

Thermometers are calibrated in various temperature scales, including Celsius (°C), Fahrenheit (°F), and Kelvin (K). Kelvin is the primary scientific scale and one of the seven base units in the International System of Units (SI).

### Temperature Scales

@fig-temp-scale shows the relationship between temperature scales and the key temperatures of consideration for each. Refer to @fig-temp-scale during the descriptions of each scale.

Note that there are three temperatures that are used as the key reference points for these scales. These are:

-   Absolute zero

-   Freezing point (temperature) of water at atmospheric pressure

-   Boiling point (temperature) of water at atmospheric pressure
